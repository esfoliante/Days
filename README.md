## The project 🔧
Days is a modern school management ecosystem that allows the student to have a deeper connection with the system itself, since all the information that he/she needs is on their mobile app.

Besides providing a clean and modern UI, Days shows the student relevant information like:
* Schedule
* Tests
* Average of all three high school years
* Among others...

<br />

## Why? 🧐

I started prototyping Days as a actual product for a company I had with a friend of mine, but when the opportunity came I decided to use this as my final school project, which has a pretty have percentage in my global evaluation.
